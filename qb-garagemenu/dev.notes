Garage Menu Vehicle Delivery for QB-Core

?? Overview
qb-garagemenu provides a simple, config-driven way for players to view and spawn their stored vehicles using qb-menu. It pulls vehicles directly from the player_vehicles table, filters them by allowed garages, and spawns them near the player with saved properties.

?? Commands
/garage ? Opens the garage menu for the logged-in player.

Shows only vehicles stored in garages listed in Config.AllowedGarages.

Supports pagination (10 vehicles per page).

Vehicle selection ? Spawns the chosen car near the player and updates its state in the DB.

? Notes
Works for all players — each sees only their own vehicles tied to their citizenid.

Invalid models are caught and reported (no silent fails).

Pagination keeps menus stable with large garages.

Debug toggle makes it easy to switch verbose logging on/off.
